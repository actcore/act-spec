# ACT: Agent Component Tools

A self-documenting RPC protocol for AI agent tools, built on the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/).

A single `.wasm` component serves AI agents (via [MCP](spec/ACT-MCP.md)), application developers (via [HTTP+JSON/CBOR](spec/ACT-HTTP.md)), CLI users, and browsers — with hardware-enforced sandboxing by default.

## Why ACT

**Universal tools, not framework-locked plugins.** Write a tool once as a Wasm component. Run it from Claude, GPT, Gemini, your own orchestrator, a REST client, or the command line. The host adapts the transport — the component doesn't change.

**Secure by construction.** Components run in WebAssembly's capability-based sandbox. No filesystem, network, or system access unless the operator explicitly grants it. This isn't a policy layer that can be bypassed — it's enforced by the runtime.

**Self-describing.** Component metadata, tool schemas, and usage instructions are embedded in the `.wasm` binary. `act info --tools component.wasm` tells you everything — no external docs or API keys needed to discover what a component does.

**Streaming and async.** Every tool call returns `stream<stream-event>`, so components can emit progress, partial results, and structured errors incrementally. Built on WASI Preview 3 native async.

### Tool Call Flow

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Host as ACT Host
    participant Wasm as .wasm Component

    Client->>Host: tools/call (MCP, HTTP, or CLI)
    Host->>Host: Validate args against JSON Schema
    Host->>Wasm: call-tool(tool-call)
    loop stream&lt;stream-event&gt;
        Wasm-->>Host: content(part) | error(err)
        Host-->>Client: SSE event / MCP response
    end
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm i -g @actcore/act        # or: pip install act-cli / cargo install act-cli

# Inspect a component from the OCI registry
act info --tools ghcr.io/actpkg/sqlite

# Call a tool directly
act call ghcr.io/actpkg/sqlite query \
  --args '{"sql":"SELECT sqlite_version()"}' \
  --metadata '{"database_path":"/tmp/test.db"}' \
  --allow-dir /tmp:/tmp

# Serve over MCP (plug into Claude, Cursor, etc.)
act run --mcp ghcr.io/actpkg/sqlite

# Serve over HTTP
act run -l ghcr.io/actpkg/sqlite
# → http://[::1]:3000/tools/query
```

## Build a Component

```bash
# Install the Rust SDK
cargo add act-sdk

# Build for WebAssembly
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release

# Embed metadata and package
act-build pack target/wasm32-wasip2/release/my_component.wasm
```

Minimal component with the SDK:

```rust
use act_sdk::prelude::*;

#[act_component("my-tools", version = "0.1.0", description = "Example tools")]
struct MyComponent;

#[act_tool(description = "Say hello")]
fn greet(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {name}!")
}
```

See the [Rust SDK](https://github.com/actcore/act-sdk-rs) for full documentation and examples. A [Python SDK](https://github.com/actcore/act-sdk-py) is also available.
